    "We all know OpenCV as one of the best computer vision libraries. Additionally, it also has functionalities for running deep learning inference as well. The best part is supporting the loading of different models from different frameworks, using which we can carry out several deep learning functionalities. The feature of supporting models from different frameworks has been a part of OpenCV since version 3.3. Still, many newcomers to the field are unaware of this great feature of OpenCV. Therefore, they tend to miss many fun and good learning opportunities."
